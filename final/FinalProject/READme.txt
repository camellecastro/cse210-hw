Project: Virtual Pet Simulation Game
Coded by: Camelle Castro

Description: This program is a Virtual Pet Simulation Game that allows users to adopt, take care of, and play with virtual pets. Each pet has its own characteristics and behaviors, and the game showcases principles of object-oriented programming like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. In addition, this project includes extra classes and features to enhance the gameplay.

Problem and Solution:
 The problem is to provide an engaging and educational game that lets users learn about responsibility and pet care while demonstrating the principles of object-oriented programming.
 The solution is a Virtual Pet Simulation Game with classes that have specific responsibilities and collaborate to create an immersive experience. The game uses encapsulation to keep internal details private and provide public methods for interaction. Inheritance is employed to create a hierarchy of pet types, and polymorphism allows for unique behaviors in derived classes.

Fundamental 4 Application/Demonstration: 
Abstraction: Create a set of classes that represent different aspects of the game, such as pets, users, petshow, activities, etc. Each class should have specific responsibilities and collaborate with other classes in the game logic.
Encapsulation: Encapsulate the internal details of each class by using private fields and provide public methods or properties for interacting with them. For example, the Pet class should encapsulate attributes like health, hunger, and happiness.
Inheritance: Use inheritance to create a hierarchy of pet types (e.g., Dog, Cat, Bird) that inherit from a base Pet class. This allows you to share common behavior among different pet types while allowing for unique characteristics in derived classes.
Polymorphism: Implement methods that are common to all pets in the base Pet class. Then, override these methods in derived classes to provide unique behavior for each pet type. For example, the Activity method can be overridden differently for each pet type.

How to play:
In your virtual pet simulation game, the "Play" interaction is an essential part of keeping the pet happy and healthy. Below are instructions for playing with your virtual pet, along with the expectations of what the player can experience during this interaction:

Play with Your Virtual Pet

Instructions:
1. Select the "Play with Pet" option from the game menu.
2. You will see a list of your adopted pets, each with a number assigned to them.
3. Enter the number corresponding to the pet you want to play with. For example, if you want to play with the first pet in your list, enter "1."
4. Don't forget to feed your pet. (Dog, Cat, Bird, Fish, or Reptile).
5. Enjoy the interaction and engage with your pet by playing and feeding them.
6. After playing with your pet, you'll receive feedback on the activity's outcome and you can see it when checking your pet status.
7. A petshow is included for all your adopted pets showcase their own different activities.

Expectations during Gameplay and Petshows:
- Dogs: Your dog might wag its tail, fetch a ball, roll over, or perform tricks. You'll see its happiness increase, and its hunger may also go up slightly.

- Cats: Your cat could meow, play with a toy, or perform acrobatic stunts. Playing with your cat will make it happier, and it might get a little hungrier.

- Birds: Your bird might mimic sounds, play with toys, or perform small tricks. Interacting with your bird will increase its happiness and may slightly increase its hunger.

- Fish: Your fish will swim around its tank, possibly interacting with decorations or following your finger along the glass. Playing with your fish will boost its happiness and may increase its hunger slightly.

- Reptiles: Your reptile might showcase climbing skills, basking under a heat lamp, or staying still like a detailed art piece. Engaging with your reptile will raise its happiness and might affect its hunger a bit.

Remember that playing with your pet is a crucial aspect of keeping it happy and preventing it from becoming too hungry, as excessive hunger could lead to your pet's health declining.

Keep an eye on your pet's overall well-being and happiness by regularly checking its status in the game. Enjoy the various interactions and activities with your virtual pets to provide them with a loving and caring environment.
